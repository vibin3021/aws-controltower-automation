This project automates the setup of a secure, scalable, and cost-optimized AWS environment using Terraform and AWS-native tools.

## Features
- **AWS Control Tower**: Establishes a Landing Zone with best practices.
- **Terraform Automation**: Automates the provisioning of resources.
- **Security & Compliance**: Enables AWS Config, GuardDuty, and IAM Access Analyzer.
- **Cost Optimization**: Sets up AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer.

In this assignment, I successfully built a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient AWS environment using AWS Control Tower. The Landing Zone setup automated account creation, enforced security rules, and centralized monitoring.

Key Highlights:
âœ… Security & Compliance
Enabled AWS CloudTrail for logging and AWS Config for compliance.
Used AWS GuardDuty for threat detection and IAM Access Analyzer for policy checks.
Implemented AWS SSO for centralized access control.
âœ… Cost Optimization
Set up AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer for cost tracking.
Created CloudWatch Alarms to alert on cost overruns.
âœ… Automation & Scalability
Used Terraform to automate VPC, subnets, and security groups setup for Control tower.
Deployed an EC2 instance .
Implemented a Lambda function for security compliance checks.


Key Takeaways:
ðŸ”¹ Security First â€“ Used AWS tools to protect resources.
ðŸ”¹ Cost Awareness â€“ Monitored spending to prevent budget overruns.
ðŸ”¹ Automation â€“ Reduced manual work with Terraform & Lambda.
ðŸ”¹ Scalability â€“ Designed for future growth and workloads.

This Assignment demonstrates my ability to design, automate, and manage a secure AWS cloud environment, aligning with Valroize Digitalâ€™s commitment to innovation and reliability.
